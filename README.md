# PhysicsStudy
This Physics Visualization App is an innovative tool designed to enhance your understanding and visualization of concepts in Physics I. The app provides real-time simulations that allow you to interact with physics concepts and observe their behavior as if you were conducting real experiments. Whether you're a student, educator, or just someone curious about physics, this app is your gateway to learn more in an interesting way!

## Features
Currently, the PhysicsStudy offers the following modules:

#### Kinematics:
- Explore projectile motion by launching a mass at various angles, initial velocities, and heights to observe its trajectory
- Discover the maximum height reached during the projectile's flight and find the distance it travels before hitting the ground

#### Circular Motion:
- Witness the dynamic effects of changing rotational velocity, tangential velocity, or radius in action
- Visualize a mass rotating around a pivot point
- Arrows indicate the direction of acceleration and instantaneous velocity, providing an intuitive understanding of how tangential velocity remains constant while the instantaneous velocity constantly changes
- Adjust the playback speed to control the visualization and study the motion in detail

Please let me know what modules/features you would like to see in the future!
